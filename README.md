## Responsibility 

Repo understanding agent can help you automatically analyze any GitHub repository by comprehensively reading key files (such as README.md, source code, and configuration files) and summarizing the repository’s purpose, main modules, usage instructions, and architecture. Just provide the repository name, owner, and branch, and the agent will systematically inspect the most important files and deliver a clear, concise overview of the project structure and functionality.

## Use the Agent 

### 1. Clone & Install Dependencies

Run [Interface Agent](https://github.com/Coral-Protocol/Coral-Interface-Agent)
<details>


If you are trying to run Open Deep Research agent and require an input, you can either create your agent which communicates on the coral server or run and register the Interface Agent on the Coral Server. In a new terminal clone the repository:


```bash
git clone https://github.com/Coral-Protocol/Coral-Interface-Agent.git
```
Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd Coral-Interface-Agent
```

Install `uv`:
```bash
pip install uv
```
Install dependencies from `pyproject.toml` using `uv`:
```bash
uv sync
```

Configure API Key
```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=
```

Run the agent using `uv`:
```bash
uv run python 0-langchain-interface.py
```

</details>

Agent Installation

<details>

Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Coral-Protocol/Coral-RepoUnderstanding-Agent.git
```

Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd Coral-RepoUnderstanding-Agent
```

Install `uv`:
```bash
pip install uv
```

Install dependencies from `pyproject.toml` using `uv`:
```bash
uv sync
```

This command will read the `pyproject.toml` file and install all specified dependencies in a virtual environment managed by `uv`.

Copy the client sse.py from utils to mcp package
```bash
cp -r utils/sse.py .venv/lib/python3.10/site-packages/mcp/client/sse.py
```

OR Copy this for windows
```bash
cp -r utils\sse.py .venv\Lib\site-packages\mcp\client\sse.py
```

</details>

### 2. Configure Environment Variables

<details>

Copy the example file and update it with your credentials:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Required environment variables:

* `OPENAI_API_KEY`
* `GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN`

* **OPENAI_API_KEY:**
  Sign up at [platform.openai.com](https://platform.openai.com/), go to “API Keys” under your account, and click “Create new secret key.”

* **GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN:**
  Log in to [github.com](https://github.com/), go to **Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens**, then “Generate new token,” select the required scopes, and copy the generated token.

</details>
  
### 3. Run Agent

<details>

Run the agent using `uv`:
```bash
uv run 4-langchain-RepoUnderstandingAgent.py
```

</details>

### 4. Example
<details>
Input:

Send message to the interface agent:

```bash
Please give me a comprehensive instruction of the master branch of Coral-Protocol/coral-server.
```
Output:

```bash
Here is a comprehensive overview of the master branch of the Coral-Protocol/coral-server repository:

**Project Purpose &amp; Main Functionality:**
- Coral Server implements the Coral Protocol, acting as a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that enables communication between AI agents via a thread-based messaging system.
- It provides tools for agents to register, create/manage threads, send messages, mention other agents, and receive notifications when mentioned.
- The server is designed to facilitate multi-agent collaboration, with a focus on composability, scalability, and secure agent communication.

**Primary Components/Modules:**
- **src/main/kotlin/org/coralprotocol/coralserver/**: Core server logic, including the entry point (`Main.kt`), server setup (`CoralServer.kt`), session management, and orchestrator for agent lifecycle.
- **mcptools/**: Implements the MCP tools (e.g., list_agents, create_thread, add/remove participants, send_message, wait_for_mentions) that agents use to interact.
- **routes/**: Defines HTTP/SSE endpoints for agent and session communication.
- **orchestrator/**: Handles agent registration, spawning, and lifecycle management.
- **examples/camel-search-maths/**: Provides a practical example of multi-agent collaboration using the server with CAMEL agents.
- **application.yaml**: Configures applications and agent registry (including how agents are orchestrated and their environment variables).

**How to Use/Run the Project:**
- The server can be run via Gradle (`./gradlew run`) or as a standalone JAR after building.
- Supports multiple modes: standard I/O, SSE server (default, port 5555), and development mode.
- Agents connect to the server and use the available MCP tools for communication.
- Example workflow: Start the server, then run the example agents (math, search, interface) in the example directory. The agents collaborate to answer user queries.

**Noteworthy Implementation Details:**
- Built in Kotlin, using Ktor for the server and SSE/WebSocket support.
- Extensible agent registry and orchestrator allow for local and (planned) remote agent management.
- YAML-based configuration for applications and agent orchestration.
- Designed for open, composable AI agent societies, with a focus on secure, scalable, and flexible communication.
- Early-stage project with ongoing development toward remote mode and expanded features.

**Summary:**
Coral Server is a foundation for multi-agent AI systems, enabling agents to communicate, collaborate, and manage conversations through a standardized protocol and set of tools. It is highly extensible and intended as open infrastructure for the &quot;Society of AI Agents.&quot; The project is not yet production-ready but provides a robust starting point for building complex agent-based systems.
