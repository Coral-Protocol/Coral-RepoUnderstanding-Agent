          from: "GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN"
```

## Use the Agent  

### 1. Clone & Install Dependencies


<details>  

Ensure that the [Coral Server](https://github.com/Coral-Protocol/coral-server) is running on your system and the [Interface Agent](https://github.com/Coral-Protocol/Coral-Interface-Agent) is running on the Coral Server.  

```bash
# Clone the RepoUnderstanding Agent repository
git clone https://github.com/Coral-Protocol/Coral-RepoUnderstanding-Agent.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd Coral-RepoUnderstanding-Agent

# Install `uv`:
pip install uv

# Install dependencies from `pyproject.toml` using `uv`:
uv sync
```
This command will read the `pyproject.toml` file and install all specified dependencies in a virtual environment managed by `uv`.

</details>

### 2. Configure Environment Variables
<details>

Get the API Keys:
- [OpenAI API Key](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
- [GitHub Personal Access Token](https://github.com/settings/tokens)

Create a .env file in the project root:
```bash
cp -r .env.example .env
```

Add your API keys and any other required environment variables to the .env file.

Required environment variables:
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`
- `GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN`






</details>

### 3. Run Agent
<details>

Run the agent using `uv`:
```bash
uv run 4-langchain-RepoUnderstandingAgent.py
```
</details>

### 4. Example
<details>

```bash
# Input:
Please give me a comprehensive instruction of the master branch of Coral-Protocol/coral-server.

# Output:
Here is a comprehensive overview of the master branch of the Coral-Protocol/coral-server repository:

**Project Purpose & Main Functionality:**
- Coral Server implements the Coral Protocol, acting as a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that enables communication between AI agents via a thread-based messaging system.
- It provides tools for agents to register, create/manage threads, send messages, mention other agents, and receive notifications when mentioned.
- The server is designed to facilitate multi-agent collaboration, with a focus on composability, scalability, and secure agent communication.

**Primary Components/Modules:**
- **src/main/kotlin/org/coralprotocol/coralserver/**: Core server logic, including the entry point (`Main.kt`), server setup (`CoralServer.kt`), session management, and orchestrator for agent lifecycle.
- **mcptools/**: Implements the MCP tools (e.g., list_agents, create_thread, add/remove participants, send_message, wait_for_mentions) that agents use to interact.
- **routes/**: Defines HTTP/SSE endpoints for agent and session communication.
- **orchestrator/**: Handles agent registration, spawning, and lifecycle management.
- **examples/camel-search-maths/**: Provides a practical example of multi-agent collaboration using the server with CAMEL agents.
- **application.yaml**: Configures applications and agent registry (including how agents are orchestrated and their environment variables).

**How to Use/Run the Project:**
- The server can be run via Gradle (`./gradlew run`) or as a standalone JAR after building.
- Supports multiple modes: standard I/O, SSE server (default, port 5555), and development mode.
- Agents connect to the server and use the available MCP tools for communication.
- Example workflow: Start the server, then run the example agents (math, search, interface) in the example directory. The agents collaborate to answer user queries.

**Noteworthy Implementation Details:**
- Built in Kotlin, using Ktor for the server and SSE/WebSocket support.
- Extensible agent registry and orchestrator allow for local and (planned) remote agent management.
- YAML-based configuration for applications and agent orchestration.
- Designed for open, composable AI agent societies, with a focus on secure, scalable, and flexible communication.
- Early-stage project with ongoing development toward remote mode and expanded features.

**Summary:**
Coral Server is a foundation for multi-agent AI systems, enabling agents to communicate, collaborate, and manage conversations through a standardized protocol and set of tools. It is highly extensible and intended as open infrastructure for the "Society of AI Agents." The project is not yet production-ready but provides a robust starting point for building complex agent-based systems.
